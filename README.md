# ICS4U-3-ModellingAndSimulation
Following in this repository are a series of exercises and examples to start our learning for object oriented programming and specifically the use of objects to model and simulate the world around us.

## Learning Goals
*I can use my understanding of object-oriented programming to develop a model and a simulation.*

I can:
- [ ] Write code that meets specific requirements
- [ ] Clearly describe the function and purpose of code
- [ ] Work effectively with others
- [ ] Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simple steps I can achieve with code
- [ ] Use coding patterns to organize my thoughts and better understand the world

## Context
For our second mini project we will be creating a model and simulation of a physical system (something that exists in the world).
**A model**: A complete, mathematical framework that describes the action of a system
**A simulation**: the result of running a model with specific starting conditions.

We have already modelled and simulated bouncing balls and the game of life. In each case we developed specific ways in which the objects would move and interact with the screen or the user.

In the case of both the bouncing ball and the game of life we simulated interactions by applying specific methods to the object. We can simulate much more complicated systems by applying different or more complicated rules. These rules for motion will appear as methods for our objects in the simulation. The forces of the physical world that affect motion have been extensively studied and can be researched for any system, and simple rules of interaction can be developed for interacting elements in the case of a finite element model.

## Process
Once you determine the forces or interactions which act upon the objects in your simulation you can use these to update the motion or properties of you simulation. You will be tasked with developing your model by identifying the objects and interactions that will be applied to each object. Once you have identified the forces Dr. Lawrence will work with you to help identify the mathematical equations that will govern the motion. You will then implement these rules in your interaction, and tune the variables in order for your simulation to run as intended. You will present this simulation with user-interaction (which may be as simple as a re-start button) that you will submit through github along with a readme file that explains your model. This readme file will include a description of your process, specifically how you identified the objects of your model, and how you developed their properties and methods.
