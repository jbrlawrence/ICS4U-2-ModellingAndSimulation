# ICS4U-3-3-Physics Simulation
Following in this repository are a series of exercises and examples to start our learning for object oriented programming and specifically the use of objects to model and simulate the world around us.

Today we will be working to develop a physics simulation together and animate a series of particles based on gravity, and interaction with the frame.

## Learning Goals
*I can use my understanding of object-oriented programming to develop a model and a simulation.*

I can:
- [ ] Write code that meets specific requirements
- [ ] Clearly describe the function and purpose of code
- [ ] Work effectively with others
- [ ] Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simple steps I can achieve with code
- [ ] Use coding patterns to organize my thoughts and better understand the world
